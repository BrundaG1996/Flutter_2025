Fixing Flutter Command Not Found in VS Code Terminal

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the correct JSON file
In VS Code, press: Ctrl + Shift + P
Type: Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)
‚Üí Pick the one that says 'User'.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add this line
Inside the { ... } JSON object, add:
"terminal.integrated.inheritEnv": true
Example:
{
    "terminal.integrated.inheritEnv": true
}
3Ô∏è‚É£ Save & Restart VS Code
Press Ctrl + S
Close VS Code completely
Reopen it.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Test
Open the VS Code terminal (Ctrl + `) and run:
flutter --version
If it works ‚Üí now run:
flutter run -d chrome
üí° If you want, you can skip this setting change and instead use a quick one-line fix to make Flutter work in VS Code terminal without changing any settings.
